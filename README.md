In this project, I started with a .csv file of world population of various countries and the population census in various years.

The file was then uploaded into Jupyter Notebook and analysed using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib for the initial exploratory data analysis where data was clean, correlation was found between various columns and other discrepancies were also found and fixed.
